### What is scripting and how is it different to coding/programming?
Scripting refers to the process of writing a script, a series of commands that can be executed to automate tasks. It's different from coding/programming in that scripting is usually used for quick and simple tasks, whereas coding/programming involves writing a full-fledged program that may have more complex logic and control structures.

### Why are scripts useful? How are they used?
Scripts are useful because they allow repetitive tasks to be automated, reducing manual effort and human error. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as data processing, system administration, and web development.

### Why Python for scripting? Why not another language?
Python is a popular language for scripting because it is easy to learn and has a large number of libraries and modules for various tasks. It is also interpreted, meaning that scripts can be run directly without the need to compile them.

### Why is scripting important for DevOps engineers?
Scripting is important for DevOps engineers because it allows them to automate various tasks in the software development and deployment pipeline, such as testing, building, and deploying code. This helps to improve efficiency and reduce the risk of errors.
### 10 examples of ways we can use scripts in DevOps (for example - Python script to query a database etc.)
1. Automating the deployment of code to production.
2. Running automated tests to validate code changes.
3. Automating the creation and management of virtual machines.
4. Automating the configuration of servers and networking devices.
5. Querying and processing data stored in databases.
6. Automating the management of source code repositories.
7. Automating the collection and analysis of log files.
8. Automating the management of backups and disaster recovery.
9. Automating the scaling of resources based on load.
10. Automating the deployment of infrastructure changes in cloud environments

### Most important Python Modules for DevOps (link to each ones documentation if possible)
There are a lot of python modules for various use cases. However, when it comes to DevOps, there are python devops libraries that you will have to use repeatedly for automation tasks.

Here are ten important Python modules for DevOps, along with links to their documentation:
